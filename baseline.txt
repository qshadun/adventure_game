Welcome to Little Cave Adventure.
You are in an open field.
You see:
a silver coin
a burly guard
a cave entrance to the east
dense forest all around
a lamp

--> talk with guard
I don't understand what you want to talk about.

--> talk about coin
You hear a burly guard say: 'Money makes the world go round...'

--> talk with guard about forest
You hear a burly guard say: 'You cannot go there, it is impenetrable.'

--> talk about cave
You hear a burly guard say: 'It's dark in there; bring a lamp!'

--> talk about east
You hear a burly guard say: 'It's just a compass direction.'

--> talk about yourself
You hear a burly guard say: 'You're not from around here, are you?'

--> talk about guard
You hear a burly guard say: 'I don't want to talk about myself.'

--> talk about hamburgers
I don't understand what you want to talk about.

--> talk
I don't understand what you want to talk about.

--> quit

Bye!
